                    In my opinion Risco del Paso is one of the most beautiful spots to ride in Fuerteventura and is personally my favourite in the entire canary islands.
                    The wind conditions can be challenging at this spot and a good level in your chosen sport is advised when heading out into the open sea, however don't let this put you off as
                    Risco del Paso has a fantastic tidal lagoon which when full allows participation for all levels.
                    ION Club is a multi-sport watersports center which offers courses, lessons and rentals. There are some restrictions on kite rentals at this spot due to the nature of the wind direction.
